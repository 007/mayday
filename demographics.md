### The best way to mess with Texas


## How to Kick Ass

To generate data with the correct histograms for age, sex, name, etc. we need to build a demographic model of the state. Any significant outliers from the expected population could be an indication that the data is false. It's far too easy to filter out all `Greg Abbot` entries from the list, so let's make sure that we look like noise instead of signal.

We'll break down the demographic model into four main parts: age, gender, name, and location.


## Age


## Gender



## How to Take Names


### First Name

First, fetch the appropriate data for [baby names by year of birth](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/state/). Those tables give you the top hundred names, segregated by sex, for each year of birth from 1960 until the present. It also gives you their relative population for the year so you can build a model per-year or per-age of what the name distribution is for that period. Scrape all of the years.


### Last Name


## Location
